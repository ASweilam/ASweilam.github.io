Ciao, I am software engineer by day and a human by night. I was born in the late [eighties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s), making me a member of the Millennial species. I am still thinking about what to write here in my bio, trust me "it is not easy". So I will take the typical boring approach of just talk about my "story".

I was born in Giza (yes, I could see the pyramids from my window), and got a biomedical engineering degree. I worked briefly in bioengineering and medical physics. Then slowly drifted to software engineering, the old school way (PCB boards). I am interested in databases and microsoft stack. Recently, I started working on my dot net core skills and have a thourogh understanding of Oracle databases. I think the hardest part of being a techie is similar to everyone else, staying critical. Being critical is what will motivate you to check out that latest hot weird-curly-brackets language or checking out that cool new same-as-old android release (btw, sucks no candy names anymore). 

I like to put my effert to benefit people. I don't want to make someone else rich (because I realised I won't be rich!), I want a cause for what I am doing, a meaning and a purpose. I think most people do that in their own way - sometimes.
