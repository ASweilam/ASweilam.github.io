Ciao, I am software engineer by day and a human by night. I was born in the late [eighties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1980s), growing up in the world, not the neighnorhood. I am still thinking about what to write here in my bio, trust me "it is not easy". So I will take the typical boring approach of just talk about my "story". 

I was born in Giza (yes, the one of the pyramids and no, I didn't commute by camels), and got a biomedical engineering degree. I worked briefly in bioengineering and medical physics. Then slowly drifted to software engineering. I am interested in databases and microsoft stack. Recently, I started working on my dot net core and develop a thourogh understanding of Oracle databases. I think the hardest part of being a techie is similar to everyone else, staying critical. Being critical is what will motivate you to check out that latest hot weird-curly-brackets language or checking out that cool new same-as-old android release (sucks no candy names anymore). My dream is to combine my hobbies into my work, slowly getting there.
I like to put my work to benefit people. I want a cause for what I am doing, a meaning and work towards the good of the whole society. I think most people do that in their own way - sometimes.
